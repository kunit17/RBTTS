To learn how preprocessing is done for TTS (text-to-speech), you can explore the following resources and steps:
1. Study Open-Source TTS Implementations:

Many state-of-the-art TTS models (like Tacotron, FastSpeech, or MelGAN) are open-source, and examining their code can provide insights into the preprocessing steps. Some common repositories include:

    Tacotron 2: https://github.com/Rayhane-mamah/Tacotron-2
    FastSpeech: https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2
    ESPnet-TTS: https://github.com/espnet/espnet
    Mozilla TTS: https://github.com/mozilla/TTS

These implementations usually include detailed preprocessing steps like:

    Text Normalization: Removing punctuation, converting numbers to words, etc.
    Phoneme Conversion: Text-to-phoneme conversion using tools like Phonemizer or Montreal Forced Aligner.
    Spectrogram Generation: Conversion of audio into Mel-spectrograms or other audio features.

2. Phoneme Conversion Tools:

Learn about phoneme conversion (from text to phonemes) as it’s a key part of preprocessing for TTS:

    Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA): A widely used tool for forced alignment, which aligns phonemes with audio. You can use this tool to generate phoneme sequences from text for training purposes.
        Montreal Forced Aligner GitHub
    Phonemizer: A Python package that can convert text to phonemes in multiple languages.

3. Text Normalization:

Text normalization is a crucial preprocessing step, especially for text-based models. It involves converting raw text into a clean form suitable for TTS. Some common steps are:

    Removing punctuation.
    Handling abbreviations (e.g., "Dr." → "Doctor").
    Converting numbers to words (e.g., "123" → "one hundred twenty-three").

You can explore libraries like:

    DeepPavlov for text normalization: https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov

4. Audio Feature Extraction:

The next step involves converting audio files into features that the model can process, like Mel-spectrograms. To learn this, look into:

    Librosa: A popular Python library for analyzing and processing audio. It provides functions for generating Mel-spectrograms and other features from raw audio.
        Librosa Documentation
    WaveGlow or HiFi-GAN: If you want to learn about high-quality vocoders that convert spectrograms back to waveforms, you can explore these models.

5. TTS Datasets:

Exploring commonly used datasets can help you understand the structure and preprocessing of TTS data:

    LJSpeech: A popular single-speaker English dataset, often used for TTS research. It includes text files and corresponding audio files for training.
        LJSpeech Dataset
    LibriTTS: A large-scale, multi-speaker TTS dataset.
        LibriTTS Dataset

Reviewing the dataset documentation often reveals the preprocessing steps that were performed on the raw data.
6. Read Research Papers:

Although many papers do not go into extensive detail on preprocessing, some do provide insights into their preprocessing pipelines:

    Look for sections in papers that describe data preparation, feature extraction, or training data pipeline.
    Papers like Tacotron, FastSpeech, and DeepVoice often provide useful details on how text is converted to phonemes and how audio features like spectrograms are generated.

7. Tutorials and Courses:

Some tutorials and online courses go in-depth into TTS preprocessing:

    DeepLearning.AI: Offers a course on speech recognition and synthesis that might cover some of the preprocessing steps.
    YouTube tutorials: There are many practical guides on TTS system building, where you can see how preprocessing is done in action.
    Blogs and Articles: Many developers and researchers write blog posts detailing how they set up their TTS pipelines.

Summary:

    Open-source TTS implementations are your best resource for understanding preprocessing steps.
    Explore phoneme conversion tools, text normalization, and audio feature extraction libraries like Librosa.
    Reviewing TTS datasets will give you insights into data preparation.
    You can also look at tutorials, online courses, and research papers to understand the various preprocessing techniques used in TTS systems.
